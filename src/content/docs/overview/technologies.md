    - Supports dependency injection and TypeScript for maintainable code.
  - Usage:
    - Core API services for RFP, RTS, escrows, and notifications.
    - Manages authentication, role-based permissions, and data processing.

- **Database**: **PostgreSQL**
  - Features:
    - Relational database for structured data storage.
    - Scalable for handling large volumes of data.
  - Usage:
    - Storing user data, entities, and workflow details.
    - Prisma ORM for seamless database interaction.

- **Real-Time Communication**: **Socket.IO**
  - Features:
    - Bi-directional, real-time communication between clients and servers.
  - Usage:
    - Enabling the chat module and real-time notifications.

#### **3. Blockchain (On-Chain)**

- **Smart Contracts**: **Solidity**
  - Features:
    - Used for deploying Entity NFTs, escrows, and on-chain metadata.
    - Implements milestone-based payment escrows.
  - Usage:
    - Securing financial transactions and enabling on-chain traceability.

- **Blockchain Network**:
  - **Ethereum / Polygon / Solana**:
    - Features:
      - Smart contract execution with low transaction fees (Polygon/Solana for cost-efficiency).
    - Usage:
      - Hosting Entity NFTs, escrows, and linking on-chain metadata for RFPs/RTSs.

- **Chainlink Integration**:
  - Features:
    - Oracles for connecting off-chain data to on-chain workflows.
  - Usage:
    - Escrow condition validation (e.g., milestones) using external data sources.

---

#### **4. DevOps**

- **Containerization**: **Docker**
  - Features:
    - Portable containerized environments for consistent deployments.
