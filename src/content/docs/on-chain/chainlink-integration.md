# On-Chain Overview

The **On-Chain** section of MyIPSpace focuses on integrating blockchain technology into the application. While the app runs primarily off-chain for performance, optional on-chain features include:

- **Smart Contracts** for escrow and secure transactions.
- **Chainlink Integration** to bridge off-chain data with on-chain networks.
- **Decentralized Identity (DID)** for user authentication and verification.

This section covers the development and deployment of on-chain components.
